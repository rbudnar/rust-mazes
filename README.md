## Mazes in Rust

This repository is an implementation of the code from the book `Mazes for Programmers` (https://pragprog.com/book/jbmaze/mazes-for-programmers) in Rust with a web front end. I'm building the maze algorithms as I go through the book. Note that I'm still learning Rust, so my code is likely not "idiomatic" from a Rust perspective.

See https://rbudnar.github.io/rust-mazes/ for a demo.

This repo was forked from: https://github.com/rustwasm/rust-webpack-template
* Install wasm-pack (you might have to switch to the nightly rust build)
* `npm run start` -- Serve the project locally for development at
  `http://localhost:8080`.

* `npm run build` -- Bundle the project (in production mode).
